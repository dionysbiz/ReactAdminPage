> This project is base on Free React Admin Dashboard made with Material-UI components and React.

## Notes for code update

To avoid error, the updated theme is used as the foundation and all changes are added back manually.
Therefore, we have to run npm install for serval library again:

#### includes
    npm install browserify-zlib path-browserify url assert crypto-browserify console-browserify stream-http https-browserify os-browserify buffer stream-browserify web3

The package.json is modified to overide since react-script is using webpack version 5  



## Getting started
